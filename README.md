My portfolio rebuilt using React

## Progress

### 2020.05.22_2143

Initial Commit.  Created react app and linked remote to github repo.

### 2020.05.22_2312

Ran npm i, and configured 'package.json' for heroku, and then created heroku app for project, and connected it to github project repo, enabling automatic deployments.  I created .pngs and .ico files with my initials to be used by the project in '/assets', and added the output images to '/public/', and then updated the links in 'index.html'.

### 2020.05.22_2335

Third attempt to fix heroku build, ran 'npm run build', and created 'build' folder structure, updated 'package.json', and ran 'npm install'.
